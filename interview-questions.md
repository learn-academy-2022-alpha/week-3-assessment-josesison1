# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: the keyword "this" in javascript is used when referring to objects and classes. It is needed to define variables in a class. It said declared as such: "this.firstName", the keyword will be followed by a period and a variable name.

  Researched answer: In JavaScript, the keyword "this" refers to an object which depends on how it is being invoked or called. It refers to different objects depending on how it is used. In object methods, "this" refers to the object but if its being used alone, it refers to the global object.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a javascript library that is used for building user interfaces, web pages, and mobile applications.

  Researched answer: React is a free and open-source front end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is used as a base in a development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The render() method is the only required method in a react class component.

  Researched answer: The only required lifecycle method that is required and will always be called is render() method, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is similar to HTML, which is a markdown language that can have embedded JavaScript. It is a language like or syntax that is used in React. The main difference between JSX and HTML is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element or it wont compile and in JSX, fragments are needed/required.

  Researched answer: JSX is a react extension to the JavaScript language syntax which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. It is similar in appearance to HTML. The major difference between the two is that in HTML, you do not need to return a single parent element, while in JSX is required.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package manager that installs the node modules. For example, the command "yarn add jest" will install the dependencies needed, and the command "yarn jest" is used to run the test, when testing.

  Researched answer: Yarn is the JavaScript manager that aims to be speedy, deterministic, and secure. It creates the files and dependencies needed.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: first time hearing "anonymous function" in Javascript, to take an educational guess, it is a function that is declared with the "function" as the name instead of "const". For example ----> function = (parameter) => {}

  Researched answer: An anonymous function is a function without a name and is required to be placed inside parenthesis, if not you will get a syntax error. The () makes the anonymous function an expression that returns a function object. An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to assign it to a variable.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: is it to describe the ability to render different user interface markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows you to render different elements or components based on a condition.

2. Props: props also known as properties which is a keyword that is used in React and it is meant for passing information from one component to another component. For example, from the parent component to child.

3. JavaScript Events: it is JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, presses a key, closes a window, and other browser tasks are all events.

4. Object-oriented programming: it is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas and inheritance of attributes and methods.

5. Ruby: its an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity.
